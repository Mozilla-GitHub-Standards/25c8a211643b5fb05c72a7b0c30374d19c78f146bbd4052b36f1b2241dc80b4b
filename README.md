# Internet Health Report

Mozilla’s new open source initiative to document and explain what’s happening to the health of the Internet combining research from multiple sources.

## Description

The site is built with Wordpress Multisite and hosting/deployment is managed through [WP Engine](https://wpengine.co.uk/). WP Engine requires a comprehensive `.gitignore` so all WP core files are excluded and will need to be installed locally.

## Installation

`cd wp-content/themes/theinternethealthreport`
`npm install`

## To run

`cd wp-content/themes/theinternethealthreport`
`gulp`
